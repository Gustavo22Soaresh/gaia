# Reimagining the OSM.org

One of the big problems with OSM.org today is its dated design, which is not very flexible for new changes and doesn't take any care with the user experience.
OSM is a social platform where you connect with your local community because you believe that a map should be made by the community for the community.


### New user profile
With more information and statics it is easy for you to identify the mapper region and if it is an active mapper.
Bringing a more familiar experience with other social networks, the new OSM profile has enormous potential for those who are looking for new mappers to add to their team.

#### organization profile
In the same way that Github has specific pages for organizations, OSM will have it to facilitate who are the organizations that work directly mapping, who participates and where they participate, the intention is to better centralize the information directly on OSM.org without having to search the Wiki .
Today if we are going to see each OSM application has a different way of dividing its teams and monitoring its performance, what I propose is that teams be created directly in OSM and made available via API to other applications.
Another point for organizations is the addition of events directly on the platform so that mappers can discover new training and Mapathonas

### Welcome popup
A way to explain to first-timers what OSM is and how they can get in touch with their local community
